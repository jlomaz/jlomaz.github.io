Weddings are very complex by nature and for that reason getting alignment before starting any design work was crucial. To tackle this complexity, we decided to focus only on the ceremony and not try to tackle all aspects of a wedding. This focused scope allowed us to launch faster while solving the most intimidating writing task couples face.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Planning the App Structure</h3><p>After we identified the key areas to focus on, I moved on to devising the app structure and what the user flows would look like for different user roles. These roles needed to have different levels of access to the tools and information regarding the wedding, requiring careful planning upfront. Aligning on these flows early with the team through flow charts helped us move faster and avoid having to rework parts of the app later on, which could be both costly and time consuming.</p><p>‍</p><figure style="max-width:3200pxpx"class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b678e31560b3934ef0b57a/68e6ba5af948085198472e2d_Wedding-Web-App-Flowchart.avif"loading="lazy"alt="Wedding App Flowchart"></div><figcaption>Wedding App Flowchart</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><h3>Wireframes</h3><p>Once we had a structure in place, we moved on to wireframes where we explored how each screen would be laid out. This allowed us to quickly sketch out different user flows without having to spend too much time thinking about visual design details.</p><p>‍</p><p>The main focus during the initial stages was on onboarding and the Ceremony builder, the main tool in Provenance’s wedding app, made to help couples write their ceremony script. This laid the foundation for further expansion and paved the way for introducing additional tools.</p><p>‍</p><figure style="max-width:3200pxpx"class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b678e31560b3934ef0b57a/68e6ba94818d152c6a0bc88a_Wireframes.avif"loading="lazy"alt=""></div><figcaption>Wedding App Wireframes</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><h3>UI Design</h3><p>With wireframes approved, I moved to UI design, creating development-ready mockups. This included defining the app's visual identity (typography, color system, component library) that aligned with brand guidelines while following UI best practices. I made sure to design for the emotional nature of wedding planning, keeping interfaces calm and encouraging rather than overwhelming. The result was a cohesive UI that developers could implement efficiently.</p><p>‍</p><figure style="max-width:3200pxpx"class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b678e31560b3934ef0b57a/68e6bab50b97f5320e0a1ce3_User-Interface.avif"loading="lazy"alt=""></div><figcaption>Wedding App User Interface</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><h3>Marketing Website</h3><p>Once the MVP was in development, I shifted my focus towards creating a marketing website that would showcase Provenance's offering and convert visitors into users. This included defining the site structure, designing the homepage and tool-specific landing pages, and planning the blog architecture.</p><p>‍</p><figure style="max-width:3200pxpx"class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b678e31560b3934ef0b57a/68e6baee67b0f97d4cbe9a4d_Marketing-Website.avif"loading="lazy"alt=""></div><figcaption>Provenance's Marketing Website</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>Once designed, I implemented everything in Webflow and maintained it over the next two years as Provenance released new products and evolved existing ones, ensuring the website expanded alongside the product.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><h2>Iterating and Evolving the Product</h2><p>After launch, we continuously improved the product, addressing user pain points and evolving the brand to better serve our audience.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Script Editor Redesign</h3><p>The Ceremony Builder is made up of 6 modules, and the initial idea was to have the user write all 6 parts separately and put them together only when the user exports a PDF. Users found this confusing and a lot of them ended up abandoning the flow, which needed to be addressed.</p><p>‍</p><p>I fixed this issue by rethinking how the tool could work. I redesigned it around a text editor screen where users can see the whole script at once, in a format very similar to other text editors they are already familiar with, along with a side-by-side view that allows users to have both the questions and the script open at once - a UI pattern I would later apply to Provenance’s AI-powered tools.</p><p>‍</p><figure style="max-width:1564pxpx"class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b678e31560b3934ef0b57a/68e6bb0ea4e26832870042ea_Script-Editor-Redesign-1.avif"loading="lazy"alt=""></div><figcaption>Provenance Ceremony Builder - Script Editor UI</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>The redesign was a success, with 10x more users successfully completing the flow. This redesigned script editor later served as a basis for other tools, like the Vow builder and Toast builder.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Evolving the visual identity</h3><p>With the core user experience solidified, the next step was evolving the brand to better reflect the product's personality. When I joined, there were preexisting brand guidelines, which we significantly evolved during the redesign. In that process, a lot of inspiration was drawn from wedding scrapbooks. Elements like torn paper, photo collages, and playful illustrations influenced the app's overall aesthetic in a meaningful way. The color palette and UI elements we defined during this process laid the groundwork for the design system we would later create.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><h2>Scaling Through AI Integration</h2><p>We launched the MVP in the fall of 2022. Only about a month after that, ChatGPT launched and started the AI wave. Since our product was a writing tool, we knew we had to adapt, or risk becoming obsolete.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Implementing Generative AI</h3><p>At the very beginning of this process, I took it upon myself to read the full developer documentation for API integration of different AI models. I researched and compared different options that could work for the Ceremony builder, comparing factors like output quality, cost per token, latency, and API availability. I also started testing the output quality different models could produce, and conducted early prompt engineering experiments.</p><p>‍</p><p>Once I had an understanding of the AI model landscape and how they could fit into the product, I created a report and presented it to the team. This document helped the team understand implementation requirements, cost implications, and distribute the tasks among appropriate roles, with my job being to design this new AI-powered version of the Ceremony builder.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Getting Ahead of a Trend</h3><p>With the strategy defined and roles assigned, we moved into the design phase. We knew we would build on top of the existing text editor tool and add AI-specific elements, but the challenge was that there weren’t many established UX patterns for AI at the time. Going back to basics, I designed an intuitive AI-powered interface, which was confirmed by later surveys and an NPS score of 70+.</p><p>‍</p><p>One detail I’m especially proud of with this tool is the side-by-side view, a UI pattern that later became standard across major AI tools, and I introduced it very early on. We shipped this feature in early 2023, while Claude introduced its <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/artifacts">Artifacts</a> feature in the summer of 2024, and ChatGPT got its <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-canvas/">Canvas</a> in the fall of 2024.</p><p>‍</p><figure style="max-width:1564pxpx"class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b678e31560b3934ef0b57a/68e6bb4f27360d8c8b97ad73_Script-Editor-Redesign-2.avif"loading="lazy"alt="Script editor - Side-by-side view"></div><figcaption>Script editor - Side-by-side view</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><h3>Removing friction</h3><p>One thing that went in our favor with the Ceremony builder was its structure which made AI the perfect way to make the process smoother for users and increase the value that the app provides. The biggest sticking point for most people was turning their answers into a first draft of their ceremony script, and Gen AI was the perfect way to solve this issue for them.</p><p>‍</p><p>Another big improvement AI brought was a much smoother experience for mobile users as it removed the need to type out the entire first draft on your own. After we implemented AI, users could simply answer questions and get the first draft in seconds. They could then just make edits to it before exporting – a much more manageable task when on mobile.</p><p>‍</p><figure style="max-width:2280pxpx"class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b678e31560b3934ef0b57a/68e6bceee6bbbe57182f2676_Provenance%20AI%20Mobile.avif"loading="lazy"alt="Generative AI - Mobile UI"></div><figcaption>Generative AI - Mobile UI</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>Since the app used a freemium model, where you can start using it for free and pay to unlock the full set of features, having a smoother mobile experience helped convert more users who discovered Provenance while using their mobile devices.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><h2>Driving Growth with SEO &amp;
CRO</h2><p>Once the main wedding tools had gone through a few iterations, the focus shifted to bringing in more users and converting them into customers.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Conversion Rate Optimization</h3><p>Since I worked on everything from the website to the paywall, I was in a unique position to help the team improve both by utilizing A/B testing. We ran a series of tests aiming to improve signups and purchases, and we managed to achieve double-digit increases in both categories. Even though this flow involved users completing a 7-step onboarding and creating an account, we managed to get signup and purchase conversion rates that are significantly higher than industry averages.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Search Engine Optimization</h3><p>Beyond optimizing conversions, we also needed to scale traffic acquisition. While I took care of technical SEO from the very start, for the last 9 months of the project, I began contributing in a more serious capacity and became the lead person in charge of SEO. In addition to technical SEO audits and website performance monitoring, I started conducting keyword research and suggesting content ideas, adding schema markup and improving internal linking, all of which resulted in a 15x increase in organic traffic and a 460% increase in ranked keywords.</p><p>‍</p><figure style="max-width:3200pxpx"class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b678e31560b3934ef0b57a/68e6bd180b3baebbad5d2a6e_Search-Engine-Optimization-Graph.avif"loading="lazy"alt="Search Engine Optimization Results"></div><figcaption>Search Engine Optimization Results</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><h3>$250, 000+ of organic traffic</h3><p>Due to the aforementioned 1554% increase in organic search traffic, the traffic value (metric showing how much money it would take to get the same amount of traffic through paid ads for the same keywords) has been averaging about $20, 000 a month. This has been the case for over a year, totaling to more than $250, 000 worth of additional organic search traffic so far, contributing greatly to the company's ability to become profitable.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><h2>Building a Multi-app Ecosystem</h2><h3>Launching Additional Tools</h3><p>Once the Ceremony Builder was launched, it was quickly followed by two more wedding tools: Vow Builder and Toast Builder. In some ways, they were similar to the existing tool, but in others, they differed, so the challenge was keeping the experience consistent, as it’s quite likely that one user will use all three tools for their wedding. Alongside these two tools, I also designed a flow for purchasing speechwriting services, enabling Provenance to diversify revenue streams beyond digital tools.</p><p>‍</p><figure style="max-width:1564px"class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b678e31560b3934ef0b57a/68e6bb4f27360d8c8b97ad73_Script-Editor-Redesign-2.avif"loading="lazy"alt=""></div><figcaption>Provenance Vow Builder</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><h3>Creating a Design System</h3><p>To keep all the tools consistent, and lay the groundwork for future expansion, we started working on a design system. In order for its implementation to be successful, all relevant teams had to be on board, so I worked on this effort alongside another product designer, and we coordinated the effort with the product manager and the developers.</p><p>‍</p><p>This design system became the foundation for rapid product expansion, reducing design and development time for new features while ensuring brand consistency across all touchpoints. It accomplished this by being a single source of truth for brand assets and standardized UI components.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Designing Cross-app navigation</h3><p>After the successful launch of the Provenance Weddings app, it was time to expand to other milestones. The next logical step was birth, so I was tasked with designing the Baby Letter Builder. This tool wasn’t supposed to be a part of Provenance’s wedding app, but live within its own app. We also decided to create tools that weren’t specific to one milestone, which would also live as separate apps.</p><p>‍</p><p>This introduced two challenges, differentiating apps and navigating between them. To address both, I introduced the idea of color coding the apps, and I also designed a system of cross-app navigation that works hand-in-hand with color coding. This color-coded navigation system allowed users to seamlessly move between milestone-specific and universal tools, creating a cohesive ecosystem experience that encouraged cross-app engagement.</p><p>‍</p><figure style="max-width:2280px"class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b678e31560b3934ef0b57a/68e6bfb4d2e41c49974960f7_Provenance%20Milestones.avif"loading="lazy"alt=""></div></figure><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><h2>Achieving Market Recognition</h2><p>The work received media recognition, with features in Vogue, The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Fortune Term Sheet, Brides, The Knot, and more.</p><h2>‍</h2></div></div></section><section class="section dark cta"><div class="w-layout-blockcontainer container narrow centered w-container"><h2 class="cta-heading">Have a design project you need help with?</h2><a id="cta-button"data-fathom-track="cta-click"data-cta-name="CTA Component"href="/contact"class="button l w-button">Get in touch</a></div></section><section class="section dark padding-120"><div class="w-layout-blockcontainer container w-container"><h2>More Projects</h2><div class="w-dyn-list"><div role="list"class="projects-grid w-dyn-items"><div role="listitem"class="w-dyn-item"><a href="/work/project/event-task-manager"class="project-wrap w-inline-block"><div class="project-grid-image-wrap"><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b678e31560b3934ef0b57a/67829062b39325149ca521ef_Eventlist-Shots-Cover-Grid.avif"loading="lazy"width="600"height="400"alt="The goal was to design a mobile app that allows event organizers to manage tasks that are coordinated between multiple teams."sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 600px"srcset="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b678e31560b3934ef0b57a/67829062b39325149ca521ef_Eventlist-Shots-Cover-Grid-p-500.avif 500w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b678e31560b3934ef0b57a/67829062b39325149ca521ef_Eventlist-Shots-Cover-Grid-p-800.avif 800w, https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66b678e31560b3934ef0b57a/67829062b39325149ca521ef_Eventlist-Shots-Cover-Grid.avif 1200w"class="project-grid-image"></div><div class="project-grid-info"><div><h3 class="project-grid-title">Eventlist</h3><div>Mobile App Design &amp;
